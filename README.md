# 💼 Bank Management System – Developed by Debdas Upadhyay

## Project info

**URL**: https://bank-management-system-xi.vercel.app/

This is a full-featured Bank Management System project developed by me, Debdas Upadhyay, using modern frontend technologies. The project is currently hosted on Vercel for fast and reliable deployment.

## 🛠️ How I Edit and Manage the Code

I manage the codebase using multiple methods depending on the workflow:

**Use VsCode**

I directly edited the project using the Vscode .Then Commit and push to GitHub through git

**🧑‍💻 Using My Local IDE**

For advanced development, I cloned the repository locally and worked in VS Code. Here's how I set it up:

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using Git
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate into the project folder
cd bank-management-system

# Step 3: Install all required dependencies
npm install

# Step 4: Start the development server
npm run dev
```
This setup gives me access to hot reload and full control over the development experience.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**💻 Using GitHub Codespaces**
I also experimented with GitHub Codespaces for browser-based editing. It provides a full IDE experience directly from GitHub:

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
